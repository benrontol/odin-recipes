    <ol>
      <li>Salt and pepper the beef cubes and toss with the flour. </li>
      <li>In a heavy Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 tablespoon of butter on high heat. Cook the meat in batches on all sides until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the beef to a plate. </li>
      <li>In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter on medium heat and add the onions and 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir to combine. Cook for at least 20 minutes and up to 40 minutes, depending on the level of caramelization you want. 
      </li>
      <li>Add the garlic, ginger, curry powder, and tomato paste. Cook, stirring constantly, for two minutes. </li>
      <li>Add the beef back to the pan and pour in the wine. Cook for 5 minutes until most of the alcohol evaporates. </li>
      <li>Add the carrots, potatoes, beef stock, and bring the mixture to a boil. As it boils, skim the top to remove any "scum." </li>
      <li>Add the bay leaf and cover, leaving the lid very slightly ajar, and simmer for 20 minutes, skimming occasionally. </li>
      <li>Remove about 1 cup of the broth from the pot and dissolve the curry roux into it. Add the mixture back into the pot. </li>
      <li>Add the milk, Worcestershire sauce, and grated apple to the pot and cook on low, uncovered, until the mixture reaches the consistency that you like. </li>
      <li>Remove the bay leaves and serve over white rice. </li>
    </ol>
