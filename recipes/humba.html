  <h2>Description</h2>
  <!--add paragraph or 2 describing the recipe (dish)-->
  <p>This is a recipe of favorite version of the Humba dish. The smell of star snise, and the slight aroma of the black beans reminds me of a abundant rural childhood in Bohol. The Humba bears similar ingredients to the Adobo, but the former is slightly sweeter and much more tender</p>
  <p>I have fond memories of this dish, and merely thinking about it warms my soul. I can picture the scene where bucketloads of pork simmer on its oil, cooked in the largest pan I had ever seen, with my numerous relatives eagerly waiting for the dish to be served. I ate this dish for a whole week, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and when it was time to go home to our province we asked for enough takeaways to last another week. </p>
